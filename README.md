# Vote Betterly: A platform for group decision-making

Vote Betterly allows the user to create "elections", each with a name, voting
method, and up to 9 options.

This is a component of the larger project. I conceived of Vote Betterly
intending it both to introduce people to the concept of alternative voting
methods and to be a useful tool for people to use for group decision-making.
